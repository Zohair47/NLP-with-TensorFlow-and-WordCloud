# 🧠 NLP with TensorFlow and WordCloud

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that demonstrates text preprocessing, word visualization using WordCloud, and model building with TensorFlow's deep learning framework.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores a sentiment analysis task using a text dataset. It walks through standard NLP techniques such as tokenization, padding, word embeddings, and visualization, followed by building and training a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NLTK  
- WordCloud  
- Matplotlib  
- NumPy  

## 📂 Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Loading dataset and inspecting the structure
- Cleaning and preprocessing the text data
- Tokenizing and padding sequences for neural network input

### 2. **Visualization**
- Generated WordClouds for positive and negative sentiment to understand word distribution
- Plotted token length distribution for better preprocessing

### 3. **Model Building**
- Created a simple neural network using `TensorFlow/Keras`
- Layers: Embedding → GlobalAveragePooling1D → Dense
- Binary classification (positive/negative sentiment)

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and loss plots
- Displayed performance metrics to interpret model effectiveness

## 📈 Results

- Achieved decent accuracy for sentiment classification
- WordClouds provided strong visual insights into common word usage in different sentiment groups

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Experiment with more advanced models: LSTM, GRU, or Transformers
- Incorporate pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec
- Try other NLP tasks: topic modeling, named entity recognition, etc.
